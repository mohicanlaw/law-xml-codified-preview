Errors of fact will be reviewed based on whether there is substantial evidence to support the finding. Judicial rulings in discretionary matters are reviewed based on whether there was an abuse of discretion. Errors that are not likely to have had a substantial impact on the decision or on substantial rights are considered 'harmless errors' and are not a basis for reversal." The Appellate Judges reviewed this case on the record and deliberations were held on February 11, 2010. This Court now issues its decision within the established scope of review.</text>

      <text><strong>In Stockbridge-Munsee Community -v- Joseph Miller</strong>, the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court of Appeals set a <em>bare requirements</em> standard for Notice of Appeal.<fn path="|footnotes|7">7</fn> In that case the Director of Tribal Services issued an Inter-Office Memorandum to the Interim Manager of Human Resources requesting an appeal of the Employee Mediation Panel's (EMP's) decision. Specifically, the memo referred to the subject as an "<em>Appeal to Tribal Court for Joe Miller Grievance" and further stated "I do not agree with the panels (sic) response. Please foreward (sic) this to the Tribal Court......</em> The Interim Manager filed the memo with the Tribal Court within the statute of limitations. However the formal Petition for Review was not filed with the Tribal Court until sometime after the statute of limitations had run. The trial court dismissed the case because it was untimely filed. The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court of Appeals disagreed and overturned the trial court stating:</text>
      <include>
        <text>
          <em>We.... conclude that the memo does constitute a Notice of Appeal. We recognize, however, that the February 18, 1997 memo meets the bare requirements for Notice of Appeal. ........ We do so with the express finding that the request was timely filed in this case.</em>

      <text>This Court finds that neither the attempted phone calls to HR or the undated letter to HR with cc: to Tribal Council, Attn: Pres. Bob Chicks meets this bare requirement standard. There is no indication of the Court being notified of any appeal in this letter. Even if a copy of the undated letter was filed with the Court it would have been filed beyond the five day statute of limitations based on the Petitioner's acknowledgement that he drafted the letter on July 8, 2009 (footnote 4).</text>

      <text>In his appeal, the Petitioner states; <em>The petitioner who has no legal training attempted to exercise his rights as a Tribal member by filing his grievance/appeal with the HR department. </em>He also states; <em>The response from HR indicated willful disregard of established Tribal policy. The next step follow-up was established by written notification of improper hiring to president Chicks, as council representative and direct admin. Supervisor of HR.</em> This Court finds that neither of these actions constitutes an exercise of Petitioner's rights as provided under <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§54.8|(C)">54.8(C)</cite> in which the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Council provided clear and specific provisions for remedies if there were violations of Tribal policy.</text>

      <text>The Petitioner references, what he considers, a disturbing comment made by defense council during the December 30, 2009 hearing that ignorance of the law is no excuse. Although the Petitioner finds this comment disturbing, ignorance of the law is a legal principle holding that a person who is unaware of a law may not escape liability for violating that law merely because he or she was unaware of its content. The rationale of the doctrine is that if ignorance were an excuse, a person charged with criminal offenses or a subject of a civil lawsuit, as in this present case, could merely claim that he or she is unaware of the law in question to avoid liability, even though the person really knows what the law in question is. The doctrine assumes that the law in question has been properly posted and distributed. It may be printed in a government newspaper, available over the internet or printed and available for sale at affordable prices. In the case at hand, this Court acknowledges that all Stockbridge-Munsee ordinances are available over the internet at Mohican.com.</text>

      <text>At the December 30, 2009 trial court hearing, Doug Miller, advocating for the Petitioner, states <em>"I am aware that there have been other parties that have used have used (sic) the preference and have filed within the five days limitation and I think you know that the fact that the case that I'm aware of is where the plaintiff was an attorney with an aunt that was a judge."</em><fn path="|footnotes|8">8</fn> Although the Petitioner may have become aware of this information during preparation for the December 30, 2009 hearing, this Court finds that the Petitioner did have knowledge of and access to the information regarding the Stockbridge-Munsee ordinances that protected his rights to appeal.</text>

      <text>The Petitioner states, <em>"You wrote the law, the attorney wrote the law and now they hide behind the law."</em><fn path="|footnotes|9">9</fn> Although it may be true that the attorney wrote the law, it is the Tribal Council who passes and enacts the law. Generally, statutes of limitations are enacted by the legislature as in this case by the Tribal Council. The Tribal Council may either extend or reduce the time limits, subject to certain restrictions, but the court cannot extend the time period unless the statute provides such authority. If the Petitioner feels that the law should be changed to extend the time period, he should approach the Tribal Council on this matter. This Court finds no statutory authority exists for it to extend the statute of limitations.</text>

      <text>In the Petitioner's Appellate Brief in Support of Appeal Court Action, he states; <em>It appears that the legal dept. has willfully created laws and conditions that restrict and prohibit the protection of Tribal preference laws enacted and mandated in <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.02">Chapter 54</cite>.</em> As stated above, it is the Tribal Council that enacts laws, not the legal department.</text>

      <text>In stating his grounds for appeal, the Petitioner states; <em>The Tribal court failed to consider, in its order to dismiss, the fundamental issue that guarantees the legal fairness of protected rights.</em> In viewing this statement, this Court finds that the guarantees of the legal fairness of protected rights is a duty of the Court, but also finds that these guarantees apply to all parties of the case, not merely the Petitioner. The Petitioner, on numerous occasions in his motion to appeal and during the December 30, 2009 court hearing, references that HR failed to inform him of a five day period in which he could appeal the denial of his hiring. He states; <em>This is a case where HR is not following it's (sic) policies and they're hurting their people.</em><fn path="|footnotes|10">10</fn> Although such a policy may have merit, this Court can find no current tribal policy requiring HR to provide appellate information when it does not hire a person for employment with the tribe. In his motion to appeal, the Petitioner states; <em>The court in its decision did not address a critical issue of Tribal law that mandates Tribal preference in hiring.</em><fn path="|footnotes|11">11</fn> This Court agrees. The trial court did not address a critical issue of Tribal law that mandates Tribal preference hiring. However, it is the Petitioner's own lack of action that barred the trial court from addressing that issue as the ordinance states;</text>
