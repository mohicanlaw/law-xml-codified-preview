  <text>On December 28, 2010, Appellant William A. Doxtator, represented by his attorney Gary S. Dodge, filed a Notice of Intent to Appeal, Motion to Waive Filing Fee, and Motion To Stay The Trial Court's Decision Pending The Final Outcome Of This Appeal, with the Clerk of Court pursuant to $23 (C) of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court Rules of Procedure. Appellant's Notice of Intent to Appeal is in reference to the <cite doc="2010-FA-0006">trial Court decision dated December 14, 2010, in Case No. 2010-FA-0006, Stockbridge- Munsee Community vs. William A. Doxtator</cite>. The trial court found William A. Doxtator guilty (dog running at large) a violation of <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="16.10|(A)|(1)">ยง16.10 (A) (1) of Chapter 16, Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Law Public Peace and Good Order Ordinance</cite>.</text>
  <text>On January 6, 2011, Appellee Stockbridge-Munsee Community represented by attorney Starlyn R. Tourtillot, a Response to Appellant's Appeal. Appellee filed a motion to deny Appellant's Request for Appeal, and deny Appellant's Motion to Stay the Trial Court's Decision Pending the Final Outcome of Appeal, and Affirm the trial court's decision.</text>
  <text>On February 16, 2011, the Court of Appeals reviewed the Notice of Intent to Appeal. The Appellant's Notice of Intent acknowledges that: "the defendant, by his counsel, is mindful that pursuant to Rule 23(J) of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Court Rules of Procedure, that he must submit a written statement of the grounds for his appeal within 20 days of filing his notice of appeal unless otherwise expedited by the court". The Appellant has failed to submit a written statement asserting any of the principle grounds for appeal, that the trial court made a serious error of fact and or law or that the trial court abused its discretion, in accordance with <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="ยง1.6|(L)|(3)">ยง1.6 (L) (3) Chapter 1 Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Law Tribal Court</cite>. The 20 days timeframe lapsed in January 2011.</text>
  <text>The Appellant failed to assert any of the principle grounds for appeal within the timeframe, without stating the grounds for appeal this matter is vague. The appeal is hereby, denied.</text>
