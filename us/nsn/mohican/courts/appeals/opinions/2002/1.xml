      <text>On October 26, 2001, the Appellant received a letter from Ms. Tammy Pecore stating that she was terminated from her position with the Mohican North Star Casino. That letter also included the Appellant's rights to grieve the termination. The letter included: <em>In the event you wish to appeal your termination, please refer to the Grievance Process on page 42 of the Green Handbook, which states, "an employee can file a grievance within 5 days of the action being grieved". Also refer to <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="|EMP.01.05">Section 53.4 </cite>and <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="|EMP.01.06">53.45 of the Employee Rights Ordinance</cite>, which states, "an employee may choose to waive the internal grievance process and file a claim directly with the Tribal Court within 30 calendar days of the event or events that gave rise to the employee's claim".</em></text>

      <text>The Appellant proceeded to the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Offices on November 26, 2001 and attempted to file a type written letter that was dated on November 15, 2001 along with a copy of her termination letter and copy of a payroll check. The Tribal Court Clerk was not at work that day, so the Appellant sought another employee of the Tribe who was not the Clerk of Court, but who identified herself as "CG" who initialed the documents. These documents were not file stamped with a date and time of filing, but were only initialed by "CG".</text>

      <text>From here the record becomes unclear as to what happened to these documents between November 26, 2001 and March 26, 2002 when the Appellant's motions were filed seeking a Court Order to direct the Clerk of Court to assign a docket number to the statement of claim and to basically get this case on the Court's calendar. This case then began to proceed to a hearing on May 03, 2002 at which time the Tribal Court denied the Appellant's Motions and granted the Appellee's <em>Motion to Dismiss the Complaint</em> without prejudice.</text>

      <text>The Appellees basic arguments are that the Appellant did not file sufficient notice of her intent to appeal her termination. Appellees argue, even though the Appellant had documents filed<fn path="|footnotes|1">1</fn> within the time frame allowed under <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.01">Chapter 53 of the Tribal Code</cite>, that those documents were deficient in meeting the requirements of notice of appeal.

      <text>The Appellees further argue that the Appellant did not follow the proper procedures in filing in Court. Their argument is; <em>….the Court procedures says the petition filed in Tribal Court under this ordinance, meaning the employee rights ordinance, may be in any written format, but shall, but shall include at least the following information. It list {sic} 4 items: name and address of the petitioner, a statement identifying the enumerated right under <cite doc="Old Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="§53.3">section 53.3</cite>; description of the facts; then 4</em><sup><em>th</em></sup><em>, specific request stating required relief.

      <text>Now we look at the document that the Appellant filed on November 26, 2001. Although the letter, dated November 15, 2001, is not signed, the Appellant does identify herself in the body of the letter by stating <em>"I Sunday R. Warrington Here b (sic) give a written statement to the decision that was made by the Manager Mr. Gerald Miller, to suspend me from my current job at the North Star Casino, on October 24, 2001.</em> She further states, in her letter; <em>"The reason for the suspension was, I'm being accused of possible fraud. To the best of my knowledge, am innocent of this accusation."</em></text>

      <num>¶18</num>
      <text>From the reading of this document, it is reasonable to conclude that the Appellant is disputing her <em>"suspension"</em>. In applying the <em>bare requirements</em> standard as established by the Stockbridge-Munsee Court of Appeals in <cite doc="97-AA-004"><em>Stockbridge-Munsee Community v. Joseph Miller</em>, Case No. 97-AA-004</cite>, we find that the Appellant did meet that standard. The Appellant did file a written notice, within the statute of limitations, which, although not conforming strictly to the rules of procedure, does set forth enough information to create a case or controversy. The Appellant can not be faulted for the absence of the Tribal Court Clerk, and had a reasonable expectation that she had files the proper documents. Had the Appellant not taken the steps to seek out another Tribal employee, who acknowledged receipt of the documents, the Appellant would fail in her appeal. However, the Appellant did make a good faith effort to appeal her termination and is entitled to her <em>day in Court</em>.</text>
