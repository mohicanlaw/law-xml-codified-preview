    <heading>SUMMARY</heading>
    <text>This is a direct appeal of the Trial Judge's dismissal of Appellant's lawsuit over an employee wage dispute with the Community. The order at issue was issued by the Tribal Court on August 17<sup>th</sup>, 2018. Appellants filed their brief with this Honorable Court on November 5<sup>th</sup>, 2018 and the Community filed an Appellee's brief on December 4<sup>th</sup>, 2018. The matter was argued before the three member Stockbridge-Munsee Court of Appeals on February 8<sup>th</sup>, 2018.</text>

    <heading>FACTS ON APPEAL</heading>
    <text>In their February 6<sup>th</sup>, 2017 petition in the Tribal Court, Appellants alleged that they received notice from the Community that their wages would be frozen pursuant to a new wage scale adopted by the Community. As a result, Appellant Hoffman's employment wages from the Community were frozen until 2022 and Appellant Miller's employment wages were frozen until 2024.</text>
    <text>Appellants requested remedies available under <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.03.15">ยง55.15</cite> of the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Fair Labor Standards Ordinance including back-pay, actual damages, punitive damages and legal fees.</text>
    <text>On March 6, 2018, the Community reconsidered the wage freeze and by motion unfroze the employee wages. Subsequent to the Community's action, the Tribal HR department paid the amount of back wages owed the Appellees. The HR determination was that Appellants would receive back-pay based on the difference between what Appellants would have received without the wage freeze and what they actually were paid. Appellant Hoffman received back- pay in the amount of $2963.45 and Appellant Miller received back-pay in the amount of $1439.90.</text>
    <text>Pursuant to the award of back-pay to each of the Appellants, the Tribal Community filed a Motion to Dismiss in this case arguing that since the back-pay rewards had been awarded, there no longer was a case or controversy. Subsequent to the Motion to Dismiss the Tribal Judge recused herself from the case.</text>
    <text>On August 20<sup>th</sup>, 2018 <em>Pro Tem</em> Judge Layatlati Hill issued a decision on the Motion to Dismiss. In granting the Motion to Dismiss, the Court ruled that the only available relief, back-pay, was granted and no further case or controversy existed.</text>

    <heading>THE COMMUNITY POSSESSES SOVEREIGN IMMUNITY WHICH CAN BE WAIVED ONLY BY THE COMMUNITY OR THE UNITED STATES</heading>
    <text>Federal Case law has on many occasions affirmed the doctrine of sovereign immunity in Tribes, (e.g., Santa Clara Pueblo v. Martinez). Only when that immunity is waived by clear language of the United States, or the Tribe itself, is a valid waiver in place</text>

      <num>A.</num>
      <text><cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="GOV.02.03|(a)">Section 29.3</cite> of the Community's Court Code contains a clear statement of the Community's immunity and circumstances by which a waiver is effective:</text>

      <text>Stockbridge-Munsee Precedent and Statutory law limit Appellant's monetary remedies to back-pay not to exceed one year.</text>
      <text>Two decisions of the Stockbridge-Munsee Appellate Court affirm that the only monetary remedy available in Community employment cases is "Back-pay not to exceed one (1) years wages"</text>
      <text>In <u>Stockbridge-Munsee Community v. Miller</u>, the Court reinstated the employee with "all back-pay, allowance and benefits less any compensation or money gained by employment or unemployment benefits since the date of termination." Only damages related to lost pay were allowable and then limited to one years' back-pay.</text>
      <text>In <cite doc="Mohican Nation Stockbridge-Munsee Band of Indians Tribal Court of Appeals Case No. AP-2008-AA-0003"><u>Dodge v. Stockbridge-Munsee Community</u>, No. AP 2008-AA-0003</cite>, the Court found that the Trial Court's award of 320 hours of PTO was a monetary award, and therefore, the award of PTO was not authorized by <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.01.07|(f)">section 53.5 (F)(3)</cite> of the Tribal Code.</text>

    <para>
      <num>D.</num>
      <text>Appellants' Claims for Relief are limited to back-pay, reinstatement, or a narrowly tailored non-monetary remedy.</text>
      <text>The Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code is narrowly written to provide a single monetary remedy back-pay. Here appellants have been awarded sums that represent the difference between what they earned and what they would have earned but-for the freeze on wages. Due to the Community's limited waiver of sovereign immunity, Appellants cannot receive payments for allegations of involuntary servitude, deprivation liberty of prosperity without due process of law, harassment and violations of the Indian Civil Rights Act (25 U.S.C. ยงยง 1301-1304), as the Court is foreclosed from hearing such claims.</text>

    <heading>CONCLUSION</heading>
    <text>This Court finds that Appellants are limited to a single monetary remedy-back-pay. Any other monetary request is precluded by the limited waiver language of Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.01.07|(f)">ยง53.5 (F)</cite>. Action by the Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Counsel in reversing the wage freeze and awarding "back-pay" was the appropriate monetary remedy.</text>
    <text>At this time, Appellants' only course of action to receive additional compensation or for other claims exceeding the limited waiver provided in <cite doc="Stockbridge-Munsee Tribal Code" path="EMP.01.07|(f)">ยง53.5 (F)</cite> would be to petition the Stockbridge-Munsee Government to recognize additional compensation or amend Tribal law to allow that compensation.</text>
